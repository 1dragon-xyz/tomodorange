## Why This App? (The Philosophy)

Most Pomodoro apps are stressful. They flash, tick, and demand your attention. **TomodOrange** is built to keep you fresh and focused.

*   **🚫 No Ticking Anxiety**: The "Minutes Only" display (e.g., "25") removes the urgency of watching seconds count down.
*   **🍊 Fresh Visuals**: Uses a vibrant **Orange** for work to keep you energized, and a refreshing **Lime Green** for breaks.
*   **👻 Ghost Mode**: A unique feature that makes the widget **click-through**. It floats over your work like a watermark, impossible to accidentally drag or close.
*   **🌊 Auditory Flow**: Uses a rhythmic **Water Drop** sound (every 1 second) during Work to induce flow, and ambient **Beach Waves** during Break to encourage relaxation.
*   **🔒 Strict Workflow**: There is **No Pause Button**. This is intentional. You either commit to the block, or you stop.
*   **🎨 Seamless Design**: Frameless, transparent, and customizable to blend perfectly with your desktop wallpaper.

## Features

*   **Always-on-Top Floating Widget**: Stays visible but unobtrusive, and **remembers its position**.
*   **Smart Transitions**: Automatically switches between Work (default 25m) and Break (default 5m) phases.
*   **Micro-Retrospectives**: Log your task, focus level, and thoughts after every session.
*   **Next Session Planning**: Decide what to do next *before* you take your break to reduce decision fatigue.
*   **System Tray Hub**: All controls are tucked away in the right-click tray menu to keep your screen clean.
*   **Customizable Aesthetics**: Adjust Opacity, Text Size, Color, and Audio Volumes to your exact preference.
*   **Lightweight**: Designed to use minimal system resources (<1% CPU).
